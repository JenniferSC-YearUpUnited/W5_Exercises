# False def if raise None del import return True elif in try and else is while as except lambda with assert finally nonlocal yield break for not class form or continue global pass ## 

# False it is a boolean operator that represenets the opposite of True #
# ^^ elif is shorthand for else if, checks if some other condition holds when the condition in the if statment is false ^^ #
# ^^ try is used to make a try except statment. The try statment starts a block of code that is tried to execute. If it fails, athe except block catches the error ^^ #
# as in Python re-assigns a returned object to a new identifier. Basically, it creates an alias #
# ^^ yield function ends a function and returns an iterator ^^ #
